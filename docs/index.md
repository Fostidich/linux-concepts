# Advanced Operating Systems

## Topics overview

- Multiplexing the CPU and address translation
    - Threads, processes and scheduling, concurrency
    - Memory virtualisation
    - System virtualisation
- Interfacing and persistence
    - I/O, disks
    - Booting
- System-level programming
    - 80% CPU Linux kernel programming (C)
    - 20% MCU OS programming (C++)

## Advanced concepts

- Scheduling policies (not only Linux's CFS)
- Virtual machines (hypervisors)
- Memory management (e.g., segmentation, buddy algorithm, Linux PFRA)
- Advanced kernel synchronization primitives (Linux's RCU and MCS)
- Modern C/C++ concurrency and design patterns
- Memory consistency models
- Booting and configuring a system (UEFI, UBoot, PCI, ACPI)
